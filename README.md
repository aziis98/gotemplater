# Gotemplater

One file CLI utility to render Go templates to stdout and files from JSON and YAML "data" files.

**Why?.** I needed an extremely simple way to render templates with a CLI as I am moving my sites to use a Makefile instead of a full static site generator.

Under here there is a small documentation but it is probabily faster if you read the code directly as it about 100 lines.

The goal is to keep the project extremely small but if some cool ideas come up I will consider adding them. 

- Documentation
- Maybe support TOML and some other formats
